Self-Supervised Noise Embeddings (Self-SNE)
============
__This is an alpha release currently undergoing development__. Examples and documentation will be added upon release of the accompanying publication. 
Not all features have been validated and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

Self-SNE is a probabilistic family of self-supervised deep learning models for compressing high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional embedding. It is a general-purpose modelling framework for multiple types of data including images, sequences, and tabular data. It uses self-supervised objectives to preserve structure in the compressed latent space.
